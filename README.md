# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This project implements a 3D Tic Tac Toe game in Python, where players can compete against an AI that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm. The game features a 3x3x3 board, providing a more complex and engaging experience compared to traditional 2D Tic Tac Toe.

## Features
3D Gameplay: Play on a 3x3x3 board.
AI Opponent: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
User Input: Players can input their moves easily.
Winner Detection: The game checks for wins or draws after each move.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy library
