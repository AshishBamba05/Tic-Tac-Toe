# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This project implements a 3D Tic Tac Toe game in Python, where players can compete against an AI that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm. The game features a 3x3x3 board, providing a more complex and engaging experience compared to traditional 2D Tic Tac Toe.

## Features
3D Gameplay: Play on a 3x3x3 board.
AI Opponent: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
User Input: Players can input their moves easily.
Winner Detection: The game checks for wins or draws after each move.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy library

## Run the game:

### python 3d_tic_tac_toe.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your moves in the format x y z, where x, y, and z are coordinates on the 3D board (values range from 0 to 2).

The computer will make its move automatically after your turn.

The game will announce the winner or if it ends in a draw.
